# 🛡️ Sentinel

## Intelligent API Security Monitoring & Vulnerability Detection Platform

> **Observe. Detect. Assess. Respond. Secure.**

Sentinel is an API security platform designed to help developers and security teams discover, monitor, analyze, and protect APIs against vulnerabilities, malicious requests, and abnormal behavior.

It combines **API inventory, OpenAPI security scanning, real-time traffic monitoring, threat detection, risk scoring, policy-based response, and incident management** into a unified security dashboard.

# 🚨 Hackathon Track

**Cybersecurity – API Security & Threat Control**

## Problem Statement

> **Build an automated tool to detect, prevent, and respond to API security threats in real time.**

---

# 🎯 The Problem

Modern applications heavily depend on APIs, making them a major attack surface.

Attackers can exploit:

- Broken authentication
- Broken authorization
- Excessive data exposure
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Missing rate limits
- API abuse
- Security misconfiguration
- Resource exhaustion
- SSRF
- Improper API inventory

These attacks can expose sensitive information, abuse business functionality, or compromise user accounts without immediately triggering traditional security alarms.

The challenge is not only detecting vulnerabilities, but also understanding **what is happening, how risky it is, and what action should be taken**.

---

# 💡 Our Solution — Sentinel

Sentinel provides a unified security workflow:

```text
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │      API SOURCE     │
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │
              ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
              │                           │
              ▼                           ▼
       OpenAPI Specification         Live API Traffic
              │                           │
              ▼                           ▼
       Security Scanner            Threat Detection
              │                           │
              └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                            ▼
                     Risk Analysis
                            │
                            ▼
                    Security Decision
                            │
             ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
             ▼              ▼              ▼
           ALLOW         MONITOR        BLOCK
                            │
                            ▼
                      RATE LIMIT / ALERT
                            │
                            ▼
                   Incident Management
                            │
                            ▼
                     Secure API
```

Sentinel combines **Shift-Left API Security** with **Runtime API Security**.

# 🔍 How Sentinel Works

## 1. Discover & Inventory APIs

Sentinel provides visibility into protected APIs and their endpoints.

API information includes:

```text
API Name
Base URL
Environment
Status
Endpoint Count
Requests in 24h
Threats in 24h
Security Score
Last Activity
```

Endpoint information includes:

```text
HTTP Method
Path
Authentication Required
Roles
Risk Level
Request Volume
Threat Count
Last Seen
```

This helps security teams understand their complete API attack surface.

---

# 2. 📡 Monitor Live API Traffic

Sentinel monitors API requests and analyzes security-relevant signals.

Each request can contain:

```text
HTTP Method
Endpoint
Status Code
Source IP
User / Session
Risk Score
Decision
Threat Type
Headers
Query Parameters
Response Latency
```

Example:

```text
GET /api/v1/users
Status: 200
Risk Score: 8
Decision: ALLOW
```

Suspicious request:

```text
GET /api/v1/users/9999/profile
Risk Score: 92
Threat: BOLA
Decision: BLOCK
Status: 403
```

---

# 3. 🚨 Detect API Threats

Sentinel analyzes API behavior and security signals to identify suspicious activity.

### Threat Coverage

| Threat | Example | Possible Response |
|---|---|---|
| BOLA | Unauthorized object access | BLOCK |
| Broken Authentication | Repeated failed logins | RATE LIMIT |
| BOPLA | Unauthorized object properties | BLOCK / ALERT |
| Injection | Malicious input/query patterns | BLOCK |
| Resource Abuse | Abnormally high request rate | RATE LIMIT |
| Security Misconfiguration | Unsafe API configuration | ALERT |
| SSRF | Suspicious internal resource access | BLOCK / ALERT |
| BFLA | Unauthorized privileged operation | BLOCK |
| Improper Inventory | Undocumented/shadow endpoints | ALERT |
| Unsafe API Consumption | Risky external API interaction | ALERT |

---

# 4. 🔎 OpenAPI Security Scanner

Developers can upload an **OpenAPI JSON specification** and analyze the API before deployment.

```text
OpenAPI JSON
     ↓
Upload to Sentinel
     ↓
Static Security Analysis
     ↓
Security Rules
     ↓
Vulnerability Findings
     ↓
Risk Assessment
     ↓
Security Score
```

The scanner checks for issues such as:

- Missing authentication
- Sensitive information exposure
- Missing pagination
- Missing rate-limit definitions
- Security misconfiguration
- Risky endpoints

Example:

```text
Security Score: 72/100
Grade: C

CRITICAL
Broken Authentication
GET /api/v1/admin/debug

CRITICAL
Sensitive Data Exposure
GET /api/v1/users/:id

HIGH
Unrestricted Resource Consumption
GET /api/v1/search
```

---

# 5. 📊 Risk Scoring

Sentinel converts security findings into an understandable security score.

The scoring model starts from:

```text
100
```

Weighted deductions:

```text
Critical → -12
High     → -6
Medium   → -2
```

Therefore:

```text
100
 - Critical Findings
 - High Findings
 - Medium Findings
 = Security Score
```

### Security Grades

| Score | Grade |
|---:|:---:|
| 90–100 | A |
| 80–89 | B |
| 60–79 | C |
| 40–59 | D |
| <40 | F |

This gives developers and security teams a quick understanding of their API security posture.

---

# 6. ⚙️ Policy & Response Engine

Detection is only the first step.

Sentinel can associate detected threats with security policies and determine the appropriate response.

```text
Threat Detected
       ↓
Determine Severity
       ↓
Evaluate Security Policy
       ↓
Take Action
```

### Response Actions

```text
ALLOW
MONITOR
ALERT
RATE_LIMIT
BLOCK
TEMPORARY_BLOCK
```

### Example

```text
Condition:
Repeated failed authentication attempts

Severity:
MEDIUM

Action:
RATE_LIMIT

HTTP Status:
429
```

Critical example:

```text
Condition:
SQL Injection detected

Severity:
CRITICAL

Action:
BLOCK

HTTP Status:
403
```

This allows Sentinel to move from:

> **Detection → Decision → Response**

---

# 7. 📋 Incident Management

Security events requiring investigation can be tracked as incidents.

An incident can contain:

```text
Incident ID
Title
Severity
Status
Threat Type
Endpoint
Source IP
Session
Risk Score
Confidence
First Seen
Last Seen
Occurrences
Action Taken
```

### Incident Lifecycle

```text
OPEN
  ↓
INVESTIGATING
  ↓
CONTAINED
  ↓
MITIGATED
  ↓
RESOLVED
  ↓
CLOSED
```

Supported statuses include:

- OPEN
- INVESTIGATING
- CONTAINED
- RESOLVED
- MITIGATED
- FALSE_POSITIVE
- CLOSED

---

# 🧠 OWASP API Security Coverage

Sentinel is designed around major API security risks inspired by the **OWASP API Security Top 10**.

The platform focuses on:

```text
Broken Object Level Authorization
Broken Authentication
Broken Object Property Level Authorization
Unrestricted Resource Consumption
Broken Function Level Authorization
Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows
Server Side Request Forgery
Security Misconfiguration
Improper Inventory Management
Unsafe Consumption of APIs
```

The objective is to provide security teams with a unified view of API risks rather than isolated vulnerability reports.
